I teach classes on "Sociological Theory" and "Introduction to Sociology" at the University of Oxford. Moreover, I also taught classes in introductory and advanced statistics at the Blavatnik School of Governance (Oxford) and Institute of Sociology and Social Psychology at the University of Cologne.
