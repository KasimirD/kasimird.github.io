I regularly teach tutorials in "Sociological Theory" and "Introduction to Sociology" to undergraduate students. Moreover, I also taught classes in introductory and advanced statistics at the Blavatnik School of Governance and Institute of Sociology and Social Psychology at the University of Cologne.
