# December 2022: ODISSEI Grant

Jochem Tolsma, Dingeman Wiertz, and I won an ([ODISSEI-LISS grant](https://odissei-data.nl/en/2022/12/liss-grants-2022-announcement/)). We are excited to study how people's preferences shape segregation in civic life.
Segregation is a pervasive phenomenon that limits intergroup contact and may undermine social cohesion, reinforce inequalities, and give rise to polarization. Our data collection aims to advance our understanding of (the drivers of) social segregation in two different settings – civic organizations and neighborhoods – to identify opportunities and obstacles for intergroup contact. Firstly, we collect rich data about people’s involvement in civic organizations, examining social sorting across and within civic organizations, and along multiple social dimensions. Secondly, we conduct innovative choice experiments to analyze to what extent different social groups embrace or avoid social diversity when choosing civic organizations or neighborhoods.
