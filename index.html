I am a Postdoctoral Prize Research Fellow in Sociology at <a href="https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/people/profiles/kasimir-dederichs/">Nuffield College</a> at the University of Oxford. Broadly speaking, my research interest centers around how members of different groups encounter, relate to, and form relationships with each other. 
</p>
<p>
In my Ph.D. thesis entitled "Who (else) is Involved? How Voluntary Associations Connect and Separate Us?", I study the role of civic organizations for social cohesion by analyzing participatory inequalities and patterns of segregation. In doing so, I look at socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and gender as key dimensions of social inequality. My Ph.D. research is funded by an ESRC grant.
</p>
<p>
In another series of projects, I use full-population register data from the Netherlands to explore patterns of inter-ethnic partnership formation.
</p>
<p>
Before coming to Oxford, I obtained my B.Sc. and M.Sc. at the University of Cologne. I have also visited the Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demographic Institute and Utrecht University for a research stay and spent a semester at the University of Groningen.
