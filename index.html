I am a Ph.D. candidate in Sociology at <a href="https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/people/profiles/kasimir-dederichs/">Nuffield College</a> and the <a href="https://www.sociology.ox.ac.uk/people/kasimir-dederichs">Department of Sociology</a> at the University of Oxford. Broadly speaking, my research interest centers around how members of different (ethnic) groups encounter, relate to, and form relationships with each other. My current academic work is guided by the question of which structural and cultural factors shape patterns of social integration in ethnically diverse societies.

In my Ph.D. thesis entitled "Who (else) is Involved? How Voluntary Associations Connect and Separate Us?", I study the role of civic organizations for social cohesion by analyzing participatory inequalities and patterns of segregation. Before coming to Oxford, I obtained my B.Sc. and M.Sc. at the University of Cologne. My research is funded by an ESRC grant.

Recently, I visited the Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demographic Institute and Utrecht University for a three-month research stay. In a joint project with Frank van Tubergen, I examine the formation of consensual unions across national origin groups.
