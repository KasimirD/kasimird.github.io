I am a Ph.D. candidate in Sociology at <a href="https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/people/profiles/kasimir-dederichs/">Nuffield College</a> and the <a href="https://www.sociology.ox.ac.uk/people/kasimir-dederichs">Department of Sociology</a> at the University of Oxford, supervised by Nan Dirk de Graaf. Broadly speaking, my research interest centers around how members of different groups encounter, relate to, and form relationships with each other. My current academic work is guided by the question of which structural and cultural factors shape patterns of social integration.

In my Ph.D. thesis entitled "Who (else) is Involved? How Voluntary Associations Connect and Separate Us?", I study the role of civic organizations for social cohesion by analyzing participatory inequalities and patterns of segregation. In doing so, I look at socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and gender as key dimensions of social inequality. My Ph.D. research is funded by an ESRC grant.
Besides, I also developed an interest in patterns of inter-ethnic partnership formation. Using Dutch register data, I have kick-started a series of projects that aim to investigate the nexus between ethnicity and partnership formation.

Before coming to Oxford, I obtained my B.Sc. and M.Sc. at the University of Cologne. I have also visited the Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demographic Institute and Utrecht University for a research stay and spent a semester at the University of Groningen.
