I am a Ph.D. candidate in Sociology at Nuffield College and the Department of Sociology at the [University of Oxford](https://www.sociology.ox.ac.uk/people/kasimir-dederichs). Broadly speaking, I am interested in questions relating to social integration and social inequalities. In my Ph.D. thesis, I study antecedents and consequences of involvement in voluntary organizations paying special attention to social networks influence in this context. Before coming to Oxford, I obtained my B.Sc. and M.Sc. at the University of Cologne. My research is funded by an ESRC grant.

Recently, one of my papers got published in the European Sociological Review. In this article, Hanno Kruse and I show how adolescents reduce their participation as they grow older, and that socioeconomic disparities are largest at younger ages. The socioeconomic gap in participation decreases in size, in part because adolescents with a high socioeconomic background disproportionally undergo transitions to higher tertiary education which are most disruptive for their involvement in voluntary associations (see more under [Publications](https://www.kasimirdederichs.github.io/publications)).
